### Steam Pictures Junction Link v.1.0.0.1 ###
This is a app that moves your Steam screenshots to your picture folder, then creates junction directories from the Steam screenshot directory to the new location. The created directories get userfriendly names (the name of the game as described by Steam's API). If the game isnt a Steam game, you are prompted to make your own name.
